Section 1 : Intro

- What is Firebase?
* Backend as service
* Provides :
database, authentication, file storage, 
cloud functions, hosting etc.
* Can plug directly into frontend.
* No need to setup our own backend.

- Setup
* Go to console
console.firebase.google.com
* Firebase v8 vs v9
> v8 uses Object oriented approach
> v9 uses functional approach
> Only import required functions.
> Can use tree-shaking : only including
used functions in final bundle js file.
